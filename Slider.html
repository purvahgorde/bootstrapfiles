                        <p class="bg-dark">Jaipur formerly known as Jeypore, is the
                            capital and the largest city of the Indian state of Rajasthan. As of 2011, the city has a
                            population of 3.1 million, making it the tenth most populous city in the country. Located
                            268 km (167 miles) from the national capital New Delhi, Jaipur is also known as the Pink
                            City due to the dominant color scheme of its buildings in old city.[9]

                            Jaipur was founded in 1727 by Sawai Jai Singh, the Kachhwaha Rajput ruler of Amer, after
                            whom the city is named.[10] It is one of the earliest planned cities of modern India,
                            designed by Vidyadhar Bhattacharya.[11] During the British colonial period, the city served
                            as the capital of Jaipur State. After Indian independence in 1947, Jaipur was made the
                            capital of the newly formed state of Rajasthan in 1949.

                        <p class="bg-dark">The history of Punjab has witnessed the migration and settlement of different tribes of
                            people with different cultures and ideas, forming a civilisational melting pot. The ancient
                            Indus Valley civilisation flourished in the region until its decline around 1900 BCE.[14]
                            Punjab was enriched during the height of the Vedic period, but declined in predominance with
                            the rise of the Mahajanapadas.[15] The region formed the frontier of initial empires during
                            antiquity including Alexander's and the Maurya empires.[16][17] It was subsequently
                            conquered by the Kushan Empire, Gupta Empire,[18] and then Harsha's Empire.[19] Punjab
                            continued to be settled by nomadic people; including the Huna, Turkic and the Mongols.
                            Punjab came under Muslim rule c. 1000 CE,[20] and was part of the Delhi Sultanate and the
                            Mughal Empire.[21] Sikhism, based on the teachings of Sikh Gurus, emerged between the 15th
                            and 17th centuries. Conflicts between the Mughals and the later Sikh Gurus precipitated a
                            militarisation of the Sikhs, resulting in the formation of a confederac
